It is not necessary to use the filters as they appear on the site. You can pick and choose the filters to get the desired results.

## Summary:

### Drawback
The main drawback is the case sensitivity. If the exact same city with same spelling is used with wrong case sensitivity then the filter will not work.

### Recommendations

1) Add exception for case sensitivity and provide result if any filter keyword match without any issue.
2) Include Date range to allo user to find UFO sighting between a range of dates
3) Pop up message when filter does not return any sighting
